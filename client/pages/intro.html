          advancement. Whether you’re looking to enter the healthcare field or enhance your current skills, Pharmacy
          Technician can be a great starting point or a long-term career choice. Here are a few reasons to consider this
          career:

          <strong>Note:</strong> Something that they make clear in my current program is that as a pharmacy technician,
          it is recommended to seek advanced training and certification to increase your earning potential and job
          opportunities. 'Stacking' certifications is a great way to do this. For example, you could start with a basic
          certification and then add on additional certifications such as preparing sterile IV products.

        <p class="mt-4">
          This program I designed will cover the PCTB certification (standard certification) and exam. Everything here
          will be things I learn and resources that have helped me. I will also post my exam results when I take the
          exam. If you are ready, proceed to the next section.

          Looking at the previous two sections, you can see that the roles of a pharmacy technician are mostly
          administrative and technical, while the roles of a pharmacist are more clinical and patient-focused. This is
          why it’s crucial for pharmacy technicians to understand their limitations and work collaboratively with
          pharmacists to provide the best care possible.
