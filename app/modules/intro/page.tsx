              <strong>Note:</strong> Something that they make clear in my
              current program is that as a pharmacy technician, it is
              recommended to seek advanced training and certification to
              increase your earning potential and job opportunities.
              &apos;Stacking&apos; certifications is a great way to do this. For
              example, you could start with a basic certification and then add
              on additional certifications such as preparing sterile IV
              products.

              This program I designed will cover the PCTB certification

              I learn and resources that have helped me. I will also post my
              exam results when I take the exam. If you are ready, proceed to

              Looking at the previous two sections, you can see that the roles
              of a pharmacy technician are mostly administrative and technical,
              while the roles of a pharmacist are more clinical and
              patient-focused. This is why it is important for pharmacy
              technicians to work closely with pharmacists to ensure that
              patients receive the best possible care. And why MTM and CPA are
              important concepts for pharmacy technicians to understand.
              Pharmacy technicians cannot provide clinical services like
              pharmacists, so something to understand is that the pharmacist
              will be mostly dealing with patient questions and assessing
              information on patient&apos;s medical history. Therefore, as a
              pharmacy technician, you will be tasked with preparing
              medications, managing inventory, and assisting the pharmacist in
              various ways so they can get their job done efficiently. In the
              end of the day it is a team effort to ensure that patients receive
              the best care possible.
