        <p>
          My name is Daniel, I am a pharmacy technician student at Dallas College. That said I am not an expert, I don&apos;t claim to be
          an expert, I am just a student sharing what I have learned. I am creating this website to help other students because I found it difficult
          to find resources. There are a lot of resources out there but most are scattered and not to my liking.
          I am creating this website to help students like myself who can&apos;t afford to pay for resources.
          This is a work in progress and I will be updating it as I go along. I hope you find this website helpful.
